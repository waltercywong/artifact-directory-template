Title:
Congestion Prediction in Chip Design with Walks and Paritioning

Abstract:
Chip design has increased exponentially in terms of complexity, leading to significant challenges in predicting and reducing wire congestion. Congestion is the term used for when there is an excessive amount of wire routing in a constrained physical area, which negatively impacts performance through overheating, signal interference, and increased power consumption. Our methodology proposes enhancements to the existing DE-HNN model by introducing skip connections to improve long-range message passing and leveraging alternative partitioning algorithms. These modifications aim to improve the accuracy of congestion prediction and optimize chip design efficiency. By evaluating these approaches against the original model, this work contributes to advancing analysis and applications of graph machine learning in analog chip design.
